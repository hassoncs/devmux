## Why devmux?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Shared Awareness" icon="approve-check">
    Both humans and AI agents use the same tmux session naming convention (`omo-{project}-{service}`). One starts a server, the other reuses it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Idempotent by Design" icon="rocket">
    `devmux ensure` is safe to run multiple times. If the service is already running, it reuses it. No port conflicts. No duplicate processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Config for Turbo" icon="document">
    Auto-discovers services from your `turbo.json`. Just run `devmux discover turbo` and you're set.

## The Problem

When AI coding assistants work on your project, they often need to start dev servers:

- **Port conflicts**: Agent tries to start API on :8787, but you're already running it
- **Duplicate processes**: Agent starts its own server, now you have two
- **No cleanup**: Agent's server keeps running after the session ends
- **No visibility**: You can't see what the agent started, agent can't see what you started

## The Solution

devmux creates **shared awareness** through tmux session naming:

```bash
# Human starts the API
devmux ensure api
# -> Creates tmux session: omo-myproject-api

# Later, AI agent needs the API
devmux ensure api  
# -> Sees omo-myproject-api already running
# -> Reuses it (no restart!)

# Check what's running
devmux status
# Service    Status    Port    Session
# api        running   8787    omo-myproject-api
```

Both human and agent see the same services. Both can start, stop, or reuse them.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize config (auto-detects from turbo.json)
devmux init

# Start your API (idempotent - safe to run multiple times)
devmux ensure api

# Check status
devmux status

# View logs
devmux attach api

# Run a command with services, cleanup on exit
devmux run --with api -- npm test

# Stop when done
devmux stop api
```

## For AI Agents

Add this to your `AGENTS.md` file so AI assistants know how to use devmux:

```markdown
## Service Management

Before starting dev servers, check if they're already running:

\`\`\`bash
devmux status
\`\`\`

To start a service (idempotent):

\`\`\`bash
devmux ensure api
\`\`\`

NEVER start servers with raw commands like `pnpm dev`. 
Always use devmux to prevent port conflicts.
```
